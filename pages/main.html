    <h4>I'm a fledgling web developer...</h4>

        <div class="textCont">
        <p>...and I'm looking for a career.  I spent a youth doing computers as a hobby
        and music as a job.  When I became aged and learned that I like money more
        than I had previously thought, I switched them.  So I went back to school and
        learned how to code, studying Java, C#, Android and even a little robotics.</p>
        <p>Along the way, a combination of curiosity, industry trends, and friends 
        working in the field led me back to the web.  And when I found the wide
        world of JavaScript and all the wonders of modern web, I knew I had found 
        what hath floated mine boat.</p>
        <p>Now, I'm building my own stuff and putting myself and my growing talents 
        out into the pool of available junior web developers.  I'm looking for an 
        employer who values talent, motivation, and passion for learning.  Contact me
        if you're in the market for an employee that's hungry and ready to jump in 
        head first!</p>

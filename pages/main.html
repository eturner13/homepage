    <h3>SUMMARIZED SUMMARY</h3>
    <h4>I'm a fledgling web developer...</h4>
        <div class="textCont flexHorz">
            <div class="summary">
            <p>...and I'm looking for a career.  I spent a youth doing computers as a hobby
            and music as a job.  When I became aged and learned that I like money more
            than I had previously thought, I switched them.  So I went back to school and
            learned how to code, studying Java, C#, Android and even a little robotics.</p>
            <p>Along the way, a combination of curiosity, industry trends, and friends 
            working in the field led me back to the web.  And when I renewed my interest,
            with the wide world of JavaScript and the wonders of the modern web waiting
            for me, I knew I had discovered what hath floated mine boat.</p>
            <p>Now, I'm building my own stuff and putting myself and my growing talents 
            out into the pool of available junior web developers.  I'm looking for an 
            employer who values talent, motivation, and passion for learning.  Contact me
            if you're in the market for an employee that's hungry and ready to jump in 
            head first!</p>

            <h4>Code</h4>
            <div class="textCont">
                <h5>HTML | CSS</h5>
                <p>
                    I'm a big fan of Sass and Flexbox<br>
                    Bootstrap is useable, I prefer to not<br>
                    Design is a joy, not a task
                </p>
                <h5>JavaScript</h5>
                <p>
                    Angular.js is good, Ember.js is my favorite<br>
                    ES6 appeals to my OOP background<br>
                    Ember-CLI and Mean-CLI are my focus ATM<br>
                    Testing and Deployment are being reviewed
                </p>
                <h5>Java | Android</h5>
                <p>
                    I've built a few basic apps<br>
                    With a LOT more in the works for mobile<br>
                    I greatly fancy Wearable and VR stuff<br>
                    Java was the first language I learned<br>
                </p>
                <h5>C# | ASP.net | Visual Studio</h5>
                <p>
                    I built a social media website for class<br>
                    It was basic, but loaded functionally<br>
                    Easy to integrate JS frameworks is good<br>
